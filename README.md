Facebook Canvas support is experimental as I have not been able to test or confirm it working. If you test it, please report back if you had success or failure.

This library do not include or support all available Facebook Graph methods. Any contribution is welcome to add more. But, please read the contributing rules before submitting any pull requests.

## Installation
1. Download the library files and add the files to your CodeIgniter installation. Only the library, config and composer.json files are required.
1. In CodeIgniter `/application/config/config.php` set `$config['composer_autoload']` to `TRUE`.
2. In CodeIgniter `/application/config/config.php`, configure the `Session Variables`.
3. Update the `facebook.php` config file in `/application/config/facebook.php` with you Facebook App details.
4. Install the Facebook PHP SDK by navigating to your applications folder and execute `composer install`.
6. Autoload the library in `autoload.php` or load it in needed controllers with `$this->load->library('facebook');`.
5. Enjoy!

## Usage
The library download includes a sample controller and views. The example code might not be the best or most beautiful code, but it is there to help you get started quicker.
